# Quizz-App
Multiple Choice Quizz Application built with Html, JavaScript, CSS

This project is an assignment given and the working code is all in the "main" branch.
The application has a 10 question multiple choice quizz. 
I started working on a function that checks which answer is correct or wrong and displays it in real time to the user but at the moment it is stil not working so it has been added on the 'progress_bar' branch.


I hope you enjoy the work done here and that this work may help me reach my goal! :)
